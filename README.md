# FlutterFootball

My first mobile project using Flutter. A small demo project for football matches, including the use of external APIs and integrating with Google Admob.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## How to use?

Add your own google-services.json file with your own admob settings.

Set up [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for remote configuration.

Get a key from [https://www.football-data.org/](https://www.football-data.org/) and add it to Remote Config of Firebase (key: football_data_api_token).
